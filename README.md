# Digit Recognizer
## The Plan
#### Part One
* Segment the image into digit images. (https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/shapedescriptors/bounding_rects_circles/bounding_rects_circles.html)
* Rescale each digit image to match the 28x28 MNIST data.
#### Part Two
* Run each 28x28 digit through the neural network which we trained with the MNIST data.
* Return the value of each digit.
#### Part Three
* Do something cool with the digit values.
